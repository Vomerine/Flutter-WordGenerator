# Startup Name Generator

A new Flutter project for generating suggestion of startup
names with WordPair. 

The project is based from the Flutter documentation 'Write your
first Flutter app' (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab).
There are some differences between the documentation and the code 
since I tried to make changes to learn how it works.

In addition, the project contains a lot of comments since this 
is where I practiced using Flutter to grasp the concept before 
doing a Todolist with a Firebase. The comments will not be 
accurate and is just based from my understanding of the code.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
